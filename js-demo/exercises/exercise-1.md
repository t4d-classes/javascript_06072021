# Exercise 1

1. Implement your own version of the `map` and `filter` functions. Please do not use the built-in `forEach`, `map`, and `filter` functions.

```javascript
nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

doubleNums = myMap(n => n * 2, nums);

console.log(nums); // [1,2,3,4,5]
console.log(doubleNums); // [2,4,6,8,10]
```

Do something similar for `myFilter` as well. To add something to an array you can use the `push` or `concat` functions. It's ok to Google the API calls.

2. Ensure both your `myMap` and `myFilter` work correctly.
